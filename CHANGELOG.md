<!--## [Unreleased][Unreleased]-->

## [0.5.1][0.5.1] _2021-10-27_

### Added

- French Translation (`fr_FR`)
  ([#83](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/83), [@Bibithom][Bibithom])

### Fixed

- An issue with canceling `null` hologramThreads.
  ([#85](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/85), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])

- Implementation of WarZoneListener, and how FlagWar utilizes WarZones.
  ([#86](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/86), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])

## [0.5.0][0.5.0] - _2021-10-13_

### Added

- New Option to require a specific number of attackers to be online in the attacking Town and/or Nation.
  ([#72](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/72), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])
    - Modifies behavior. Originally, this quota was determined by the same method used for defenders.

- New Option to have conquered Town blocks unclaimed instead of transferred to the attacker.
  ([#73](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/73), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])

### Changed

- **Towny Target:**
  - Minimum version required is _**0.97.2.0**_. It is recommended to use the latest version available to you.
  
- FlagWar will now respect Towny's per-world settings for allowing war.
  ([#69](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/69) _nice..._, [@LlmDl][LlmDl])
  - Originally used exclusively for Towny's EventWar.

- GitHub Actions
  - Now tests against Eclipse Temurin, from [Adoptium][adoptium].
  - Tests against both JDK 16 and JDK 17.

- In `CellUnderAttack.class`, replace uses of `scheduleSyncRepeatingTask()` with `runTaskTimer()`.
  - Should be purely aesthetic, but also removes a deprecation warning. SSRT simply calls RTT under the hood.

### Fixed

- Fixed NullPointerException found in OutlawEventListener.
  ([#79](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/79), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])

- Fixed Jitpack building.
  - Specifically uses Microsoft's build of OpenJDK 17, and Maven 3.8.3 (As opposed to Oracle JDK 8, Maven 3.6.1)
  - [Tested Working](https://jitpack.io/com/github/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/main-7d7ba1c80e-1/build.log) 

## [0.4.0][0.4.0] - _2021-08-12_

### Added

- `FlagWarAPI#isUnderAttack(Nation)`; returns `TRUE` if any Town in the supplied Nation contains a cell under attack.

- New `OutlawListener` to listen for the `OutlawTeleportEvent`
  - Outlaws cannot be teleported away during an attack while in enemy territory (or enemy Nation Zone) during an active
  war.
  - Add `error.outlaw.cannot-teleport-here` translation key, sent to the outlaw.

### Changed

- `rules.time_to_wait_after_flagged` replaced by `rules.prevented_interaction_cooldown, which uses DHMS formatting.
  - The (long) `FlagWarConfig#getTimeToWaitAfterFlagged()` API endpoint remains, but will default if the node is missing
    or empty. (Default Value: `600000l`, _10 minutes_.)
  - This change should reflect the purpose of the node, which has never prevented follow-up attacks.

- Bumped Towny dependency to 0.97.0.22; set 0.97.0.17 as Min_Towny_Version

- Bumped Config Version to 1.3 (Post 0.3.0...)

- Set Bukkit API version flag to 1.16 (From 1.17)
  - Reflects "Support API-1" policy.

### Removed

## [0.3.0][0.3.0] - _2021-07-17_

### Added

- Added Optional Holograms for War Flags ([#58](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/58), [@gaffy00][gaffy00])
  - Requires HolographicDisplays to function.

### Changed

- Build Targets: Java 16 (was 8), Paper 1.17.1, Towny 0.97.0.12

### Removed

- `alternatives` Maven profile from the FlagWar pom file.

- API: `CellUnderAttack#isFlag(Block)`
  - Previously deprecated; use `#isFlagTimer(Block)` or `#isFlagPart(Block)` instead.

### Fixed

## [0.2.0][0.2.0] - _2021-06-18_

### Added

- Checkstyle configuration, based on traditional Sun style guidelines with some modified rules.

- A Messaging utility class, with debug methods. Config option to enable debug messaging.
([PR #40](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/40))

- A viewer-friendly Changelog (this document).

- The ability to change War Flag timer materials.
  ([Pull Request #49](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/49), [@gaffy00][gaffy00])
    - Phase timing can be adjusted by increasing the ratio of specific materials.
    - Example: Using `matX, matX, matX, matY, matY, matZ` produces a flag with three phases, at a 3:2:1 timing ratio.

### Changed

- Change `config:flag.waiting_time` to work as expected. Now reflects total length of a flag, not of the flag phase.
  ([PR #38](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/38))

- Bumped Dependencies: Towny 0.97.0.6, Java 11, Paper 1.16, Annotations (various), Checkstyle Configuration

### Changed

- Made logger calls "lazy" (Using lambda expressions)
    
### Fixed

- Null listeners preventing plugin loading.

- Certain setting being loaded from Towny's in-built implementation, instead of self-contained settings.

## [0.1.0][0.1.0] - _2021-02-18_

### Added

- FlagWarAPI wrapper class.

- `.gitattributes` to enforce and preserve file formatting on Git operations.

- Dependabot dependency tracking.

- WarZoneListener specific to FlagWar (Broken)

- Standalone Plugin Configuration (Not CommentedConfiguration based)
