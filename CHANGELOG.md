### Known-Issues
- Impossible to attack plots that have
[blocks placed at world build height](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/issues/84). Marked as release-blocker for
the next release (0.5.3, or, 0.6.0)

### Added

- `VALIDATED_TOWNY_VER` version field:
  - Stores a manually-updated version string, containing the highest tested version of Towny that we've validated
  FlagWar for.
  - If a newer version of Towny is run, a startup warning is issued from either of the following translation keys.
    - `startup.check-towny.new.stable-release`
      - "Running Version of Towny released after FlagWar version. Are you up-to-date?"
    - `startup.check-towny.new.pre-release`
      - "This Towny Pre-Release is newer than what we've tested. Please report any issues."
    - _French and Spanish (MX) keys were machine-translated using [bing translate](https://translate.bing.com/). If you
    are familiar with either, feel free to drop in and make sure that the translation is appropriate._

- `rules.nations_can_toggle_neutral` config setting. _Default: `FALSE`_
  ([#96](https://github.com/TownyAdvnaced/FlagWar/pull/#96), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])
  - Replaces the now removed option that was in Towny. If False, prevents Towny from
  allowing Nations to become neutral. 
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏èIt is important for users to not run FlagWar 0.5.1, or older, with Towny 0.97.2.15, or newer. The required API
    used for determining player-set neutrality in older releases is no longer present in newer Towny versions.

- WarZone Configuration Section and Enhancements 
  ([#88](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/88), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])
  - Bumps Config version to 1.5 
  - New Config section 'warzone' containing the following keys:
    - `warzone.editable_materials` (list)
      - List of materials that can be interacted with in war zones; Or, alternatively, cannot be interacted with.
      - Accepts wildcards `*` and negations `-{material}`.
    - `warzone.item_use` (boolean)
      - Enables / Disables item usage in war_zones.
    - `warzone.switch` (boolean)
      - Enables / Disables use of switches in war zones.
    - `warzone.fire` (boolean)
      - Enables / Disables fire in war zones, add `-fire` to `warzone.editable_materials` for complete fire protection
        when this is false.
    - `warzone.explosions` (boolean)
      - Enables / Disables explosions in war zones.
    - `warzone.explosions_break_blocks` (boolean)
      - Enables / Disables explosions effecting Blocks.
  - API: Enhanced FlagWarConfig
    - Add `#setEditableMaterials()` (void)
    - Add `#isAllowingExplosionsInWarZone()` (bool)
    - Add `#isAllowingExplosionsToBreakBlocks()` (bool)
    - Add `#isAllowingFireInWarZone()` (bool)
    - Add `#isAllowingSwitchInWarZone()` (bool)
    - Add `#isAllowingItemUseInWarZone()` (bool)
    - Add `#isEditableMaterialInWarZone(Material)` (bool)

### Changed

- Build System
  - Bumped SpotBugs-Annotations, Checkstyle, and IntelliJ Java Annotations
  - Bumped Minimum Towny Version to 0.97.3.0. Same as validated version.

- Refactored Holograph line population methods to reduce complexity. (commit: b08e1fa41a74019a2559d1dac7c2430f78ef22fc)
  - This is a code-quality change, and should have no bearing on server operations.

- Changed how time is tracked and calculated: ([#89](https://github.com/))
  - FlagWar will now use Duration and Instant instead of the primitive `long` when storing cool-downs and timestamps.

- Changed how payments / fees are calculated: Using BigDecimal to avoid IEEE754 floating-point inconsistencies.
Scale to 2, use "Bankers' Rounding" (HALF_EVEN)

- Refactored how Messaging.debug(string, args) functions: Use `Object...` over `Object[]`, mimicking String.format().
  - Avoids passing args as `new Object[]{arg1,arg2,etc}`

### Fixed

- Fix `Cell#parse(WorldCoord)` (Also from [#88](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/8))

### Deprecated API

- `CellAttackEvent#getTime()` (long)
- `CellAttackEvent#setTime(long)`
- `CellUnderAttack#formatTime(int, string)` (String)
- `FlagWarAPI#getFlaggedTimestamp(Town)` (long)
- `FlagWarConfig#getFlagWaitingTime()` (long)
- `FlagWarConfig#getTimeBetweenFlagColorChange()` (long)

## [0.5.1][0.5.1] - _2021-10-27_

> Note, two editions of 0.5.1 exist: Git Tag `0.5.1` and Git Tag `0.5.1b`. This changelog represents the latter, which 
> is an amended release.

### Added

- French Translation (`fr_FR`)
  ([#83](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/83), [@Bibithom][Bibithom])

- Expansion of the WarZoneListener
  ([#87](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/87), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])
  - Now implements listeners for the following Towny Events:
    - `TownyBurnEvent`
    - `TownyExplodingBlocksEvent`
    - `TownyExplosionDamagesEntityEvent`
    - `TownBlockPVPTestEvent`
  - Follows the Towny WarZoneConfig like the Build/Destroy/Switch/ItemUse events do.
  - Also adds `Cell#parse(WorldCoord)` method for convenience.

### Fixed

- An issue with canceling `null` hologramThreads.
  ([#85](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/85), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])

- Adjust implementation of the WarZoneListener, and how FlagWar utilizes WarZones.
  ([#86](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/86), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])

## [0.5.0][0.5.0] - _2021-10-13_

### Added

- New Option to require a specific number of attackers to be online in the attacking Town and/or Nation.
  ([#72](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/72), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])
    - Modifies behavior. Originally, this quota was determined by the same method used for defenders.

- New Option to have conquered Town blocks unclaimed instead of transferred to the attacker.
  ([#73](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/73), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])

### Changed

- **Towny Target:**
  - Minimum version required is _**0.97.2.0**_. It is recommended to use the latest version available to you.
  
- FlagWar will now respect Towny's per-world settings for allowing war.
  ([#69](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/69) _nice..._, [@LlmDl][LlmDl])
  - Originally used exclusively for Towny's EventWar.

- GitHub Actions
  - Now tests against Eclipse Temurin, from [Adoptium][adoptium].
  - Tests against both JDK 16 and JDK 17.

- In `CellUnderAttack.class`, replace uses of `scheduleSyncRepeatingTask()` with `runTaskTimer()`.
  - Should be purely aesthetic, but also removes a deprecation warning. SSRT simply calls RTT under the hood.

### Fixed

- Fixed NullPointerException found in OutlawEventListener.
  ([#79](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/79), [@LlmDl][LlmDl])

- Fixed Jitpack building.
  - Specifically uses Microsoft's build of OpenJDK 17, and Maven 3.8.3 (As opposed to Oracle JDK 8, Maven 3.6.1)
  - [Tested Working](https://jitpack.io/com/github/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/main-7d7ba1c80e-1/build.log) 

## [0.4.0][0.4.0] - _2021-08-12_

### Added

- `FlagWarAPI#isUnderAttack(Nation)`; returns `TRUE` if any Town in the supplied Nation contains a cell under attack.

- New `OutlawListener` to listen for the `OutlawTeleportEvent`
  - Outlaws cannot be teleported away during an attack while in enemy territory (or enemy Nation Zone) during an active
  war.
  - Add `error.outlaw.cannot-teleport-here` translation key, sent to the outlaw.

### Changed

- `rules.time_to_wait_after_flagged` replaced by `rules.prevented_interaction_cooldown, which uses DHMS formatting.
  - The (long) `FlagWarConfig#getTimeToWaitAfterFlagged()` API endpoint remains, but will default if the node is missing
    or empty. (Default Value: `600000l`, _10 minutes_.)
  - This change should reflect the purpose of the node, which has never prevented follow-up attacks.

- Bumped Towny dependency to 0.97.0.22; set 0.97.0.17 as Min_Towny_Version

- Bumped Config Version to 1.3 (Post 0.3.0...)

- Set Bukkit API version flag to 1.16 (From 1.17)
  - Reflects "Support API-1" policy.

- A Messaging utility class, with debug methods. Config option to enable debug messaging.
([PR #40](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/40))

- A viewer-friendly Changelog (this document).

- The ability to change War Flag timer materials.
  ([Pull Request #49](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/49), [@gaffy00][gaffy00])
    - Phase timing can be adjusted by increasing the ratio of specific materials.
    - Example: Using `matX, matX, matX, matY, matY, matZ` produces a flag with three phases, at a 3:2:1 timing ratio.

### Changed

- Change `config:flag.waiting_time` to work as expected. Now reflects total length of a flag, not of the flag phase.
  ([PR #38](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/pull/38))

- Bumped Dependencies: Towny 0.97.0.6, Java 11, Paper 1.16, Annotations (various), Checkstyle Configuration

- Made logger calls "lazy" (Using lambda expressions)
    
### Fixed

- Null listeners preventing plugin loading.

- Certain setting being loaded from Towny's in-built implementation, instead of self-contained settings.

## [0.1.0][0.1.0] - _2021-02-18_

### Added

- FlagWarAPI wrapper class.

- `.gitattributes` to enforce and preserve file formatting on Git operations.

- Dependabot dependency tracking.

- WarZoneListener specific to FlagWar (Broken)

- Standalone Plugin Configuration (Not CommentedConfiguration based)
